## GROUP LIVING ANIMALS

> * Hierarchies form quickly and spontaneously
> * Usually through assymetrical displays of dominance

## PREVALENCE OF HIERARCHIES

Structure of Human Hierarchies is usually multidimensional.

## NOW WE KNOW

> * Hierarchies is a defining feature of absolute majority of organisations. 
* They stand on Power and Status. 
* It naturally emerges from interactions. 
It is an explicit or implicit rank order of individuals or groups with respect to valued dimensions.

Dominance Hierarchy 
> * Male Hierarchies
> * Females are Oppressed
* Superiority in Size, Power and Agression

## EGALITARIAN 
> Cooperation to overthrow an overly aggressive male
 It is a type of behaviour which flattens the hierarchy. And there is no particular dominance factor or order.

## FINALLY 
* Absolute majority of nature organized in a hierarchy
* Hirarchies of dominance in social species, including humans
> They are not necessary!
* Is it a product of culture or any other factors?
